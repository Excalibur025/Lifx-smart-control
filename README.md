# Lifx-smart-control
This is a collection of scripts and rough frameworks to control the Lifx smart lightbulb remotely using python.
Please note that you will need to provide your own API key under the "Token" value for most of these files.
You'll also need to create and account and follow standard set-up procedure for your devices locally: https://community.lifx.com/

I am NOT affiliated with Lifx or any partner companies in any way. I'm just a tinkerer.
